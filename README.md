We made the highlights of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2022 with this ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2022 Data Analysis Project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. **Pandas**- for providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures. you can find instructions on how to install and use Pandas on your computer[here](https://pandas.pydata.org/getting_started.html) 

2. **NumPy** - It is used for working with arrays and a wide variety of mathematical operations on arrays.Instructions of installing NumPy on your computer can be found [here](https://numpy.org/)

3. **Matplotlib** - used for creating 2D graphs and plots by using python scripts. Instruction to install and use can be found[here](https://matplotlib.org/)

4. **Seaborn** - it helps making statistical graphics in python. Instruction to install and use can be found[here](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

5. **Juputer Notebook** - allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.Instruction to install and use can be found[here](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/)

### Installing

Once you have installed all the above mentioned libraries on your computer,

1. Clone the project to your computer by running `git clone https://github.com/cyboravidell/ICC-Men-s-T20-World-Cup-2022---data-analysis` on your Git terminal.

2. In the directory of the folder `ICC-Men-s-T20-World-Cup-2022---data-analysis` containing the files of the respository, open up the terminal and run `jupyter notebook`.

4. By clicking on the 'ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2022.ipynb', you view all the analysis of the call logs and its visualization.

## Build With 

-[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/retro/notebooks/?path=Untitled.ipynb)- Web-based interactive computing platform.

-[Python3](https://www.python.org/doc/)- Python is very popular general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented and high-level programming language. 

### Tasks
 
We were asked to perform some tasks on the dataset for analysis and visualization. By using the already mentioned librarie and python programming language, we completed them.
